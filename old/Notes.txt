Web development is a big PITA. I’ve found that using a local dev server via nodejs is very very helpful.  
 
Anyways, for simple local development this is prob easiest (and the minimal amount of effort):
 
Install nodejs on your system (also available through miniconda if you already have conda installed on your system)
  https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  This should then be available globally if it’s on PATH (probably done for you by default)
Then install the simple http-server package/tool
  npm -i -g http-server (very popular)
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
From your project root (folder containing index.html of MRIcroWeb)
 Run: http-server -p 5050 (or any port you want)
Then open your browser to localhost:port
 
Just tried this and it worked well for me locally with the MRIcroWeb repo.
 
Nodejs comes with npm, a general purpose package manager for javascript development. So you can pin versions for packages etc. similar to pip with python. Even that is a PITA because you usually have to “bundle” your js files using another tool. It takes some getting used to, and switching between package managers can be a bit of a headache. The js development workflow is not a great as simple python/matlab. For local dev though, those bullet points above should cover most of your use cases.
